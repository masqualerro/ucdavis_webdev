				<h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>

							Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog
							Windows

						by Naema Baskanderi was interesting because of it’s
						focus on the design of something that most people find
						annoying. Most users immediately dismiss modal windows
						as an annoyance in order to return to the main page of
						the website, so how would one go about designing one of
						these windows to combat that effect? When designing a
						modal window, the designer should include an immediately
						accessible escape hatch in order to close exit the
						window, as well as a title providing the user with
						context as to why the modal window is there. Already,
						these will make the user feel as if they have control
						over the modal. In my opinion, the most important choice
						in the integration of a modal window into a webpage is
						to make it user initiated. Even if a modal is incredibly
						well designed, if it is an unexpected popup the user
						will likely dismiss it immediately. By triggering the
						modal window on a button click or prompt from the user,
						the user will be inclined to engage with that modal
						window because it showed up from their own doing. Modal
						windows are an excellent way to grab the user’s
						attention and effectively collect user input, but it is
						imperative that they are integrated in a way that does
						interrupt user flow and the user’s freedom of choice on
						the webpage.

				<h2>Best Practices for Form Design: Response</h2>
				<article id="lj1">
					<p>
						<i>Best Practices for Form Design by Salim Ansari</i>
						reinforced the importance of minimalism in basic
						functions, clearly defined instructions, and positive
						feedback towards the user. An example of minimalism in a
						basic function is the display of password requirements
						on a form. Many sites hide password requirements until
						the user fails to fulfill them. Instead of adding this
						additional feature to the password field, it would be
						better to simply list the password requirements
						immediately to avoid extra complication. This also
						speaks to the value of positive feedback and respect for
						the user’s time, in that it decreases the chance for
						“failure” from the user. A proper form should only feel
						positive and “understanding” to the user; communication
						from the webpage should seem more friendly and less cold
						and robotic. For example, an alert saying “Please enter
						your name” would be more pleasant than one saying “You
						did not enter your name,” and the labeling of a
						non-required field as “optional” would be more pleasant
						than red alerts on required fields. In my opinion,
						<a href="https://github.com/">github</a>
						does this very well. Whenever I go to my account
						settings to update/change information, most of the input
						fields have a message underneath explaining how to use
						that field/providing helpful information and additional
						resources.
