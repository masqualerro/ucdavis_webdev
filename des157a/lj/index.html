				<h2>Every Picture - Reading, Research & Response</h2>

						This image is interesting to me because of the narrative
						possibilities it provides. To me, this shows the
						personalities of the cats, and hints towards their roles
						in the group of stray cats that inhabit the outside of
						my office building. The black cat seems feisty and
						alert, as it crouches and stares directly at the camera
						with bright orange eyes. The gray tabby lies back in a
						majestic manner, paying the camera no mind. If these
						cats were in a fantasy book, it would seem that the
						tabby is the leader of the pack, and the black cat is a
						scout or a warrior.
						<br />
						I was assigned to review Louis Shek’s photos, and he
						sent me several pictures of luxury sports cars. These
						photos are interesting to me because of their
						technical/mechanical aesthetics. The exterior of the
						cars are sharp and direct but also constantly changing
						with different indents in the body or complex mechanical
						components. I think that these pictures provide lots of
						possibility for zooming and focusing on specific parts
						of each car.

				<h2>Every Picture - Reading, Research & Response</h2>
				<article id="lj3">
					<p>
						While searching for inspiration for my
						<i>Every Image</i>
						project, I found
						<a href="https://theshift.tokyo/en/">The Shift</a>
						on the
						<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>
						website. The Shift is a design firm in Tokyo, and they
						have a super cool image/cursor interaction on their list
						of projects and clients. While scrolling through the
						list, an image representative of the project title being
						hovered over follows the cursor, and changes with a
						snappy transition as the user hovers over a different
						project. I found this interaction particularly
						inspirational in the minimalism and space it afforded to
						the list, while still maintaining an emphasis on images.
						By placing images for the projects in the background
						following the cursor, it enables the list of projects to
						be centered in the middle of generous negative space
						with a large font size, because it does not have to be
						squeezed in next to fixed images of each project.
						Despite this, no emphasis on images was lost, since they
						were included in a creative, interactive, and
						unobtrusive manner. The
						<i>Every Image</i>
						project will produce an image-heavy page, and I will be
						inspired to include my typography in a thoughtful and
						balanced manner that will not result in the images
						overwhelming the type and vice-versa.

				<h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>

						<i>
							Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog
							Windows
						</i>
						by Naema Baskanderi was interesting because of it’s
						focus on the design of something that most people find
						annoying. Most users immediately dismiss modal windows
						as an annoyance in order to return to the main page of
						the website, so how would one go about designing one of
						these windows to combat that effect? When designing a
						modal window, the designer should include an immediately
						accessible escape hatch in order to exit the window, as
						well as a title providing the user with context as to
						why the modal window is there. Already, these will make
						the user feel as if they have control over the modal. In
						my opinion, the most important choice in the integration
						of a modal window into a webpage is to make it user
						initiated. Even if a modal window is incredibly well
						designed, if it is an unexpected popup the user will
						likely dismiss it immediately. By triggering the modal
						window on a button click or prompt from the user, the
						user will be inclined to engage with that modal window
						because it showed up by their own doing. Modal windows
						are an excellent way to grab the user’s attention and
						effectively collect user input, but it is imperative
						that they are integrated in a way that does interrupt
						user flow and the user’s freedom of choice on the
						webpage.

				<h2>Best Practices for Form Design: Response</h2>
				<article id="lj1">
					<p>
						<i>Best Practices for Form Design by Salim Ansari</i>
						reinforced the importance of minimalism in basic
						functions, clearly defined instructions, and positive
						feedback towards the user. An example of minimalism in a
						basic function is the display of password requirements
						on a form. Many sites hide password requirements until
						the user fails to fulfill them. Instead of adding this
						additional feature to the password field, it would be
						better to simply list the password requirements
						immediately to avoid extra complication. This also
						speaks to the value of positive feedback and respect for
						the user’s time, in that it decreases the chance for
						“failure” from the user. A proper form should only feel
						positive and “understanding” to the user; communication
						from the webpage should seem more friendly and less cold
						and robotic. For example, an alert saying “Please enter
						your name” would be more pleasant than one saying “You
						did not enter your name,” and the labeling of a
						non-required field as “optional” would be more pleasant
						than red alerts on required fields. In my opinion,
						<a href="https://github.com/">github</a>
						does this very well. Whenever I go to my account
						settings to update/change information, most of the input
						fields have a message underneath explaining how to use
						that field/providing helpful information and additional
						resources.
