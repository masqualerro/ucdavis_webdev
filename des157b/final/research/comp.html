						This website prompts the user to enter their birth year, then try their best to identify songs
						from different decades. After 10 songs, they display your results and a write up on how music
						has been passed to different generations. I'd like to base my website off of this in terms of
						interaction from the user. I think it would be fun to let the user interact with art on the
						website itself and contexutalize themselves within the context of the website. instead of just
						reading data that I have accumulated.

						This website charts the "timelessness" of songs through spotify data. In other words, which hits
						from past decades have maintained high streaming numbers and which have faded into obscurity. I
						like this project because of its creative data visualization and interactive charts. Ideally,
						I'd like to display interactive data similar to this on my final.
