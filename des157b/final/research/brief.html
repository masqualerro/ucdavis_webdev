					<h2>Project Brief</h2>
					<p>
						My final website will interact with the concept of how different generations react to art and
						music. My intention is to explore how taste in art is formed and passed down, as well as what
						different generations value in a piece of art. What are the overlaps and deviations?

					<h2>Project Goals</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							How is taste in art formed? Does it begin with family influence and what has been passed
							down, or is it contingent on the individual?
						</li>
						<li>
							If two people of different generations enjoy the same piece of art, what do they each value
							in it? What are the overlaps and deviations?
						</li>
						<li>Collect data on family influence in art and personal taste.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Design Strategies</h2>
					<p>
						My website design will be minimal and brutalist, with the intention of keeping the emphasis on
						user interaction with art. My background colors will be white, black, or brown, and my type will
						be green, red, black, or white. Navigation will be simple and straightforward, and art will be
						centered and own most of the viewport.

					<h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
					<p>
						User interaction in my website will exist in the consumption and reaction to art. The user will
						choose to interact with music or fine art, then be taken to a gallery displaying random pieces
						from their chosen medium. The user can then cycle through these and submit their reaction to
						each piece. The user can decide when they want to stop, then be shown a collection of their data
						based on their reaction, medium, year, and genre of each piece.

					<h2>Experience Goals</h2>
					<p>
						ii. I hope to provide the user with a sense of exploration and randomness while interacting with
						my website. I hope to make the user reflect upon their tastes in art and how they formed them.
