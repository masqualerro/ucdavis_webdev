				<p>
					This essay explores the “Intergenerational Continuity of Taste” in relation to music and families –
					how the musical taste of parents can be passed down or lost on their children. The essay also
					examines the structure of music taste itself and music I relation to gender, class etc. This essay
					is based on a survey with multiple test subjects, which will inspire me in how I choose to approach
					my data collection process for my project.

				<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>

					This article gathers multiple outside sources to supplement their definition of "Culturual
					Heritage:"
					<br />
					<br />
					<span style="font-style: italic">
						Cultural Heritage is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on
						from generation to generation, including customs, practices, places, objects, artistic
						expressions, and values.
					</span>
					<br />
					<br />
					I am interested in exploring how music taste and personal art taste fits into Cultural Heritage, as
					I feel like it is incredibly relevant in a time where art is endlessly accessible.

				<h2>What is Cultural Heritage?</h2>

				<p>
					This article provides more definitions of "Cultural Heritage." There is one section in particular on
					the difference between tangible and intangible cultural heritage -- material objects and artifacts
					and concepts, tastes, traditions, ideas.
					<br />
					This is fascinating to me because the passing of art to new generations is both intagible and
					tangible -- tangible items are the conduit for the sharing of art while the concept of developing
					taste and knowledge is intagible.
